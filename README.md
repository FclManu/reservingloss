# Non-Life Reserving Loss:  

Welcome to reservingloss package! This package can be an easy solution in order to analyze and carry out Non-Life reserving calculations. 

## The tool includes: 
  - Link Factors calculation.
  - Development factors according to different calculation methods (Volume Weight, Time Weight, Arithmetic Average, Median, Geometric Average, Minimum Factor, Maximum Fator, Median Average).
  - Graphics to represent Triangles, Link-Factors, Development Factors, Tail Factors.
  - Tail Factors (Weibull, Exponential, Power, Inverse Power).
  - Deterministic Projections: Chain-Ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson.
  - Chain-Ladder Tests: Linearity Test.

## To be implemented in the future:
  - New Deterministic Projections: Cape-Cod, Munich Chain-Ladder.
  - Extraction of Payment Pattern and Future CashFlows.
  - Discounting of Future CashFlows and Web Scrapping to download EIOPA RFR Curves.
  - New Chain-Ladder Tests: Residual Test, Calendar Test, Correlation Test.
  - Stochastic Methods: Mack CL, Merz-WÃ¼thrich, Bootstrap.
